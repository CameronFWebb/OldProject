Old solo project when I was first learning react.
Project was for an unnamed company that wanted individual parts and collections of parts to be scannable and editable by mobile app.
This included multiple applications to integrate into how the company already worked including an Excel to Database C# program, an ASP.NET api program, a webpage to easily view and edit the database and a mobile application to scan and edit the database.
This project was abandoned early on but still served as a good lesson on React and revision on C#.
